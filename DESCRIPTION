Description: Provides functionality for calculating pregnancy-related dates and
    tracking medications during pregnancy and fertility treatment. Calculates
    due dates from various starting points including last menstrual period and
    IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) transfer dates, determines pregnancy progress
    on any given date, and identifies when specific pregnancy weeks are
    reached. Includes medication tracking capabilities for individuals
    undergoing fertility treatment or during pregnancy, allowing users to
    monitor remaining doses and quantities needed over specified time periods.
    Designed for those tracking their own pregnancies or supporting partners
    through the process, making use of options to personalise output messages.
