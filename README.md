This is a work-in-progress R package for tracking dates and medications
in pregnancy and fertility treatment. It is in the early stages of
development.

**Update 2023-03-25:** After a long hiatus, I am now actively returning
to work on this project. The R code will be getting a major overhaul.
All the package best-practices, like documentation, tests, vignettes, a
pkgdown website etc, are also forthcoming. And thereâ€™ll be a hex sticker
too!

<!-- ## Installation -->
<!-- You can install the development version of pregnancy from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("EllaKaye/pregnancy") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(pregnancy) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
