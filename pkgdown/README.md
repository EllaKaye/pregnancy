This site uses Lemon Milk Pro for the body Maxi Round for headers and MonoLisa for code.

They are paid-for fonts and I have bought licenses for them.

Anyone wishing to use these fonts in their sites MUST purchase their own licenses for the webfonts, available from the following sites:

- Lemon Milk Pro: <https://www.myfonts.com/collections/lemon-milk-pro-font-marsnev>
- Maxi Round: <https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/maxi>
- MonoLisa: <https://www.monolisa.dev> (note that the Complete license is required for the webfont)
