This is an R package for calculating dates and tracking medications during pregnancy and fertility treatment. 
It extends a private, personal package that I wrote for myself when I was pregnant.
It contains functions and features that I found useful at the time, 
and others that I added when adapting the package for general use.

The functionality goes beyond what's offered by online pregnancy calculators and apps, 
plus there are no concerns (unlike with these sites and apps) about data privacy, tracking or advertising.

> This R package is in the final stages of development, with a view to release in early September 2025.
> 
> The main functionality is now in place.
> 
> Still to do: some improvements to documentation, finish vignette, better test coverage, improve some of messages in some utils functions.

## Installation 

You can install the development version of pregnancy from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: 

``` r 
# install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("EllaKaye/pregnancy") 
```

## Usage

This is a quick tour. 
For a more extensive guide, see the [Get Started](https://ellakaye.github.io/pregnancy/articles/pregnancy.html) vignette, 
`vignette("pregnancy")`.

```{r}
library(pregnancy)
```

## Date calculations

```{r}
# invisibly returns a Date object with the estimated due date
# by default, start date of last menstrual period, but other options available
due_date <- calculate_due_date(as.Date("2025-02-24"))
```

```{r}
# set the pregnancy.due_date option
# avoids having to pass the due date as argument to other functions
set_due_date(due_date)
```

This README was built on **`r format(Sys.Date(), '%B %d, %Y')`**, 
so for the purposes of reading this page, that counts as "today".

```{r}
# don't need to specify `due_date` since option is set
how_far()
```

```{r}
# alternative `on_date`, addressed as "I"
how_far(on_date = as.Date("2025-09-17"), person = 1)
```

```{r}
# when a given week of the pregnancy is reached
date_when(33)
```

## Tracking medications

```{r}
# a simplified medication schedule
meds <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~medication, ~format, ~quantity, ~start_date, ~stop_date,
  "progynova", "tablet", 3, as.Date("2025-08-21"), as.Date("2025-08-30"),
  "progynova", "tablet", 6, as.Date("2025-09-01"), as.Date("2025-09-11"),
  "cyclogest", "pessary", 2, as.Date("2025-09-03"), as.Date("2025-09-11"),
  "clexane", "injection", 1, as.Date("2025-09-08"), as.Date("2025-11-05")
)
```

```{r}
# how much of each medication is left to take, as of "today"
medications_remaining(meds)
```

```{r}
# how much medication for a given week 
# (useful if you need to request a prescription)
medications_remaining(
  meds, 
  on_date = as.Date("2025-09-01"), 
  until_date = as.Date("2025-09-06")
)
```

## Global options

`how_far()` and `date_when()` both need to know the pregnancy due date,
and this can be passed directly to the `due_date` argument.
It would be very tedious, however, to have to enter a due date every time you call these functions over the course of a pregnancy, 
especially since that date is constant throughout. 
Similarly for the medications table in `medications_remaining()`.
To avoid this, the pregnancy package makes use of **global options**, 
which can be set with the `set_*` family of functions (`set_due_date()`, `set_person()`, `set_medications()`, 
and retrieved with the corresponding `get_*` family of functions.
These options will persist for the duration of the current R session.
Any global option can be unset by calling its `set_*` function with the argument `NULL`.

```{r}
# a different due date from the earlier example
set_due_date(as.Date("2026-04-01"))
```

```{r}
how_far()
```

```{r}
# check and then unset option
get_due_date()
set_due_date(NULL)
```

### Options in `.RProfile`

We recommend adding your options to your `.RProfile` so they persist across R sessions.
R should read in these options when it loads, and you should then not need to use the `set_*` family of functions. 
The `get_*` family of functions should retrieve the options set in `.RProfile`. 
**Note: there appears to be an [issue](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/9211) in Positron where the R console *isn't* properly loading `.RProfile` on start-up.**

Here's an example of what that might look like:

``` r
options(
  pregnancy.due_date = as.Date("2025-09-16"),
  pregnancy.person = "I", # addressed in first person
  pregnancy.medications = dplyr::tribble(
    ~medication, ~format, ~quantity, ~start_date, ~stop_date,
    "progynova", "tablet", 3, as.Date("2025-04-21"), as.Date("2025-04-30"),
    "progynova", "tablet", 6, as.Date("2025-05-01"), as.Date("2025-07-11"),
    "cyclogest", "pessary", 2, as.Date("2025-05-03"), as.Date("2025-07-11"),
    "clexane", "injection", 1, as.Date("2025-05-08"), as.Date("2025-09-05")
  )
)
```
