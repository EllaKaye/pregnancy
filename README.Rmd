This is an R package for calculating dates and tracking medications during pregnancy and fertility treatment. 
It extends a private, personal package that I wrote for myself when I was pregnant.
It contains functions and features that I found useful at the time, 
and others that I added when adapting the package for general use.

The functionality goes beyond what's offered by online pregnancy calculators and apps, 
plus there are no concerns(unlike with these sites and apps) about data privacy, tracking or advertising.

> This R package is in the latter stages of development, with a view to release in early March 2025.
> The main functionality is now in place.
> Still to do: improved documentation, vignette(s), better test coverage, improve some of messages in some utils functions.

## Installation 

You can install the development version of pregnancy from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: 

``` r 
# install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("EllaKaye/pregnancy") 
```

## Usage

This is a quick tour. For a more extensive guide, see the [Get Started](https://ellakaye.github.io/pregnancy/articles/pregnancy.html) vignette, `vignette("pregnancy")`.

```{r}
library(pregnancy)
```

## Date calculations

The `calculate_due_date()` function estimates the pregnancy due date. 
The `start_date` is interpreted differently, depending on the `start_type`. 
By default, the `start_type` is the last menstrual period, and the `start_date` is the date this started.
Other `start_date` options, like various transfer days, are useful for those using IVF.

```{r}
# invisibly returns a Date object with the estimated due date
due_date <- calculate_due_date(as.Date("2024-12-10"))
```

This README was built on **`r format(Sys.Date(), '%B %d, %Y')`**, 
so for the purposes of reading this page, that counts as "today".

```{r}
how_far(due_date = due_date)

# alternative `on_date`, different subject
how_far(on_date = as.Date("2025-04-02"), due_date = as.Date("2025-09-16"), person = "Ruth")
```

```{r}
date_when(28, due_date = due_date)
```


## Tracking medications

```{r}
# a simplified medication schedule
meds <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~medication, ~format, ~quantity, ~start_date, ~stop_date,
  "progynova", "tablet", 3, as.Date("2025-04-21"), as.Date("2025-04-30"),
  "progynova", "tablet", 6, as.Date("2025-05-01"), as.Date("2025-07-11"),
  "cyclogest", "pessary", 2, as.Date("2025-05-03"), as.Date("2025-07-11"),
  "clexane", "injection", 1, as.Date("2025-05-08"), as.Date("2025-09-05")
  )
```

```{r}
# how much of each medication is left to take, as of today
medications_remaining(meds)
```

```{r}
# how much medication for a given week (useful if you need to request a prescription)
medications_remaining(meds, on_date = as.Date("2025-04-23"), until_date = as.Date("2025-04-29"))
```

## Global options

It would be very tedious to have to enter a due date every time you call `how_far()` or `date_when()` over the course of a pregnancy, 
especially since that date is constant throughout. 
Similarly for the medications table in `medications_remaining()`.
To avoid this, the pregnancy package makes use of **global options**, 
which can be set with the `set_*` family of functions (`set_due_date()`, `set_person()`, `set_medications()`, 
and retrieved with the `get_*` family of functions.
Any global option can be unset by calling its `set_*` function with the argument `NULL`.

```{r}
set_due_date(due_date)
```

Then `how_far()` can be called without needing to specify any arguments, 
and `date_when()` only needs the target week:

```{r}
how_far()
```

To check what the option is set to, use `get_due_date()`.

*Write this section!*

### Options in `.RProfile`

We recommend adding your options to your `.RProfile` so they persist across R sessions.
Here's an example of what that might look like:

``` r
options(
  pregnancy.due_date = as.Date("2025-09-16"),
  pregnancy.person = "I", # addressed in first person
  pregnancy.medications = dplyr::tribble(
    ~medication, ~format, ~quantity, ~start_date, ~stop_date,
    "progynova", "tablet", 3, as.Date("2025-04-21"), as.Date("2025-04-30"),
    "progynova", "tablet", 6, as.Date("2025-05-01"), as.Date("2025-07-11"),
    "cyclogest", "pessary", 2, as.Date("2025-05-03"), as.Date("2025-07-11"),
    "clexane", "injection", 1, as.Date("2025-05-08"), as.Date("2025-09-05")
  )
)
```
